"""Decoder/encoder for the Omni Pro II program record.

A "program" is one line in the panel's built-in automation engine —
the panel-side counterpart to a Home Assistant automation. Each panel
stores up to 1500 programs in a fixed-size table: in a .pca file
they live in a 21,000-byte block (1500 × 14 bytes); on the wire they
are exchanged one at a time via :class:`clsOLMsgProgramData` /
:class:`clsOL2MsgProgramData`.

The Omni Pro II has the ``DoubleProgramConditional`` feature flag
set, so each record is **14 bytes** with two condition slots:

==========  ==============================================
Offset      Field
==========  ==============================================
0           ``prog_type``  (``ProgramType`` enum)
1-2         ``cond``        (LE u16; first AND-IF condition)
3-4         ``cond2``       (LE u16; second AND-IF condition)
5           ``cmd``         (``Command`` enum from
                            :mod:`omni_pca.commands`)
6           ``par``         (byte parameter)
7-8         ``pr2``         (LE u16, usually object#)
9-10        ``month, day``  (or ``day, month`` in the .pca
                            on-disk layout when ProgType==Event;
                            see "Mon/Day swap" below)
11          ``days``        (``Days`` bitmask)
12          ``hour``        (0-23)
13          ``minute``      (0-59)
==========  ==============================================

**Byte order:** all 16-bit fields above are **little-endian**
(byte N is the low byte, byte N+1 is the high byte). This was
empirically confirmed against PC Access — see findings notes
in ``pca-re/clausal-re/FINDINGS.md``. Older versions of this
module decoded them as BE; the LE encoding is correct.

When ``prog_type == Remark`` (4), bytes 1-4 hold a 32-bit BE
RemarkID instead of cond/cond2; the lookup table that resolves an
ID back to the user-visible remark text lives elsewhere on disk
and is not implemented yet.

**Mon/Day swap (a quirk worth knowing about):**
There are two byte layouts in the wild for the same Program record.

* **Wire layout** — ``clsOLMsgProgramData`` and
  ``clsProgram.ToByteArray()``: bytes at offsets 9/10 are always
  ``[month, day]``, regardless of program type. This is what the
  panel sends over UDP/TCP.
* **File layout** — what ``clsProgram.Read/Write`` writes into a
  ``.pca`` file: same layout *except* for ``prog_type == Event``,
  where bytes 9/10 are swapped to ``[day, month]``.

Our :class:`Program` dataclass normalises both to semantic fields
(``month`` and ``day`` always mean what their names say). Use
:meth:`Program.from_wire_bytes` / :meth:`encode_wire_bytes` for
on-the-wire messages and :meth:`Program.from_file_record` /
:meth:`encode_file_record` for ``.pca`` table slots. The split is
load-bearing for round-trip stability.

What this module deliberately does NOT do (yet):

* Decode the internal bit-split of ``cond`` / ``cond2`` into
  selector + operand (zone#, security mode, time clock, etc.).
* Recognise the When/At/Every/And/Or/Then connector ProgTypes that
  string multiple records into one user-visible "program line" —
  none appear in any fixture we have, so the multi-record encoding
  is still un-RE'd.
* Resolve RemarkID → RemarkText (the lookup table is on a TODO).

    The 11 values split into two encoding families. Which family a

    can only express the compact family**:

    * **Compact** (``FREE`` / ``TIMED`` / ``EVENT`` / ``YEARLY`` /
      ``REMARK``, values 0-4): always available. The whole user-visible
      block (1 trigger + up to 2 AND conditions + 1 action) fits in one
      14-byte record. The trigger discriminates the form; cmd/par/pr2
      carry the inline action; cond/cond2 carry up to two AND-IF
      conditions. PC Access calls this a "simple program".
    * **Multi-record** (``WHEN`` / ``AT`` / ``EVERY`` / ``AND`` / ``OR``
      / ``THEN``, values 5-10): one record per "line" in the block.
      Used when the block would need 3+ conditions, an OR alternative,
      or a comment block — anything the compact form can't express.

# ---- Multi-record (firmware ≥3.0.0) AND-record companion enums ------
#
# When PC Access emits a block in multi-record form (one 14-byte record
# per visual line), an AND record (ProgType=8) carries a *structured*
# condition. The byte layout per ``clsProgram.cs:326-436`` is:
#
#   byte 0      : prog_type (= 8)
#   byte 1      : OP             (enuCondOP)
#   byte 2      : Arg1_ArgType   (enuCondArgType)
#   bytes 3-4   : Arg1_IX        (u16; disk byte order — see note below)
#   byte 5      : Arg1_Field     (per-type sub-field enum)
#   byte 6      : Arg2_ArgType   (enuCondArgType)
#   bytes 7-8   : Arg2_IX        (u16)
#   byte 9      : Arg2_Field
#   bytes 10-11 : CompConst      (u16; constant operand for comparison ops)
#   bytes 12-13 : (unused)
#
# Special case: when OP == Arg1_Traditional (=0), the AND record's
# condition is rendered from ``Cond`` (bytes 1-2 as u16) using the same
# per-family scheme as compact-form ``cond`` — see
# ``clsText.cs:2281-2284 GetComplexConditionText``. The richer
# ``Arg1_*`` / ``Arg2_*`` / ``CompConst`` fields are only used when
# ``OP > 0``.
#
# **Disk byte order for the three u16 fields: big-endian.** Verified
# empirically by authoring ``AND IF ZONE 5 SECURE`` and observing the
# zone number (5) at byte 4, not byte 3. So ``Arg1_IX``, ``Arg2_IX``,
# and ``CompConst`` are decoded as ``(body[N] << 8) | body[N+1]`` —
# the *opposite* of compact-form ``cond`` / ``cond2`` / ``pr2``, which
# are LE. Different record families use different byte orders.
#
# Still open: byte 1's semantic role. The C# accessor says it's ``OP``
# (`enuCondOP`), but empirically `0x04` in byte 1 corresponds to the
# ZONE family code (matching ``ProgramCond.ZONE``) rather than
# ``Arg1_GT_Arg2`` (which the C# enum would assign). Most likely byte
# 1 carries the family code when ``OP`` is implicitly Traditional
# (the common case), and only takes structured ``OP`` values when the
# user picks a comparison operator. A future capture of ``AND IF
# TEMPERATURE > 70`` would resolve this.
#
# We don't expose a structured ``AndRecord`` decoder yet — the raw 14
# bytes are still accessible via ``Program.raw`` for callers who
# need them, and the two open questions on the structured form make
# a partial decoder risk shipping wrong field interpretations.
